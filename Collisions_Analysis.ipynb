tidied and prepared for the linear and DNN regressors, with the high degree of initial variability removed. This led to strong RMSE reductions vs average values, indicating that the models were able to work effectively on the data provided to produce consistent predictions. There were limited differences observed between the linear and DNN regressors, suggesting that the predictor variables available were not sufficient for the models to create more accurate predictions. On a similar note, the removal of the weather varaible from one run of the linear regressor indicated that the day of the week predictor was providing almost all of the models' predictive power. The implication of this observation was that the weather factors were generally very weak in predicting the number of collisions, in agreement with the low correlation values recorded during initial evaluation of the data. This demonstrates that with a large dataset there is a risk of generating statistically significant corellations when the practical impact of such relationships is very small.\n","\n","A weakness of this study was using the same dataset for the training, testing and validation. A better option would have been to generate a dataset from a different year for evaluation, to determine if the model would still perform well. Creating the validation data from the teaching set only demonstrates the strength of the model with the data already encoutnered, and so general utility cannot easily be extrapolated. However the process of generating an additional dataset that correctly matches the format requirements after data cleaning would have been time consuming. The best option would have been to create the validation data set at the same time as the main data set, to make the workflow more streamlined.\n","\n","A second opportunity with workflow would have been to return the outputs of the validation process to R for further visualisation. Within the scope of this report this would have been a challenge, as the worksheet sequencing would have become complex, but plotting the regressor outputs against (for example) days of the week would have an improvement in demonstrating how successfully the models were performing.\n","\n","Finally, if a measure of total traffic activity were available then the collisions data could be expressed relative to the number of vehicle journeys. This would be likely to result in a flat profile, which could then potentially be used as a cleaner background signal to detect subtle differences in weather effects. Overall the best recommendation for emergency service presence on the roads in this report was be to follow the days of the week collision pattern identified: lowest presence on Sunday, more on Saturday, then further increases from Monday to Friday.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WLHcYbvkQE0g"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["References:\n","\n","The packages used for data processing in this section of the report were Pandas, NumPy and Tensorflow.
